High Priority:
* When setting private key unchecked and applying changes and coming back to bookmark settings, the path is empty!


Medium Priority:
* In macOS , creating new seesion window - it's frameless. No close or minimize buttons. Investigate (on windows - yes)
* When selecting and right clicking on terminal - it should copy the contents to clipboard
* When closing all tabs, it still shows last tab contents. It should not show anything.
* You can select the text and icon and badge of bookmark. Don't do it. "user-select: none;"
* Instead of dynamically create bookmark, make it template, and somehow get that template and change it.


Low Priority:
* Support "folders" in bookmarks and also recursive folders
* Change default app menus (top menu - file, help..)
* When pressing ESC on login window, bookmarks settings window, or anything like that, close the window
* Instead of electron-store look for json file read-write so I don't have to manage appending and removing from the json file.


Long term goals:
* Add support for SFTP and add on the left panel the SFTP browser. Maybe look into native bootstrap. Or use w2ui.
* When right clicking on terminal and clipboard is text then paste to terminal
* Add support for Dark Mode (like in macOS) (For now it's light force)
* Think about UI and useability. Maybe we can make it better looking while having better productivity. Think what you would like to add to make it easier.
