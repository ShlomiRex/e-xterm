High Priority:
* Learn how other programs, like Hyper or other pgorams that use xterm.js are saving / using SSH sessions.
    Link for programs that use xterm.js: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/
* When opening 1 SSH session and login success, and opening 1 more and login fails, then it shows 2 error messages instead of 1 !


Medium Priority:
* When double clicking the window, it resizes to full screen. Tell terminal to fit.
* In macOS , creating new seesion window - it's frameless. No close or minimize buttons. Investigate (on windows - yes)
* Use SSH-KEYGEN to automate SSH logins.  Or find another way.
* Use SSH2 npm module with private key
* When changing session name in bookmark settings it should update the text on ui


Low Priority:
* Support "folders" in bookmarks and also recursive folders
* Add support for Dark Mode (like in macOS) (For now it's light force)
* Change default app menus (top menu - file, help..)


Long term tasks:
* Add support for SFTP and add on the left panel the SFTP browser. Maybe look into native bootstrap. Or use w2ui.

* xterm.js sequences: https://xtermjs.org/docs/api/vtfeatures/
