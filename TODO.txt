High Priority:
* IMPORTANT: Use SSH-KEYGEN to automate SSH logins.  Or find another way.
* Use SSH2 npm module with private key
* Keep using xterm.js, looked at internet and it's the best option
* Learn how other programs, like Hyper or other pgorams that use xterm.js are saving / using SSH sessions.
    Link for programs that use xterm.js: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/


Medium Priority:
* In macOS , creating new seesion window - it's frameless. No close or minimize buttons. Investigate (on windows - yes)

Low Priority:
* Support "folders" in bookmarks and also recursive folders
* Add support for Dark Mode (like in macOS) (For now it's light force)
* Change default app menus (top menu - file, help..)
