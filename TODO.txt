High Priority:
* Learn how other programs, like Hyper or other pgorams that use xterm.js are saving / using SSH sessions.
    Link for programs that use xterm.js: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/
* Use SSH-KEYGEN to automate SSH logins.  Or find another way.
* Use SSH2 npm module with private key


Medium Priority:
* In macOS , creating new seesion window - it's frameless. No close or minimize buttons. Investigate (on windows - yes)


Low Priority:
* Support "folders" in bookmarks and also recursive folders
* Change default app menus (top menu - file, help..)
* When pressing ESC on login window, bookmarks settings window, or anything like that, close the window


Long term goals:
* Add support for SFTP and add on the left panel the SFTP browser. Maybe look into native bootstrap. Or use w2ui.
* When selecting and right clicking on terminal - it should copy the contents to clipboard
* When right clicking on terminal and clipboard is text then paste to terminal
* Add support for Dark Mode (like in macOS) (For now it's light force)
